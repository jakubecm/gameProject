# Notes for Claude Code

## What this is

School project of two developers. First-person labyrinth game set in a datacenter. Every run, the
datacenter is assembled from prefab rooms on a grid. The player deduces from physical clues (sector,
rack row, temperature, exclusions) which node has "mutated" and physically disconnects it before the
infection reaches the gateway. Hacking minigames on in-world terminals give the clues.
The rogue AI talks to the player only via short text messages on terminals.

- Engine: Unity 6.6 LTS, URP (Forward+), PC (Windows), Input System package
- Team: Developer A = systems (generator, solver, run state, minigames Password + Breach);
  Developer B = rooms, lighting, sound, UI, minigames Log + Patch panel
- Player-facing text is **Czech**. Code, comments, commit messages and file names are **English**.

## Project layout

```
Assets/
  _Project/
    Art/        Models, Materials, Textures
    Audio/      SFX, Music, Mixers
    Code/
      Core/     pure C# (generator, solver, clues) — asmdef ColdShutdown.Core, no UnityEngine references
      Runtime/  MonoBehaviours, level builder, run director, terminals, UI — asmdef ColdShutdown.Runtime
      Editor/   editor tools and generators (menu: Tools/Cold Shutdown/...) — asmdef ColdShutdown.Editor
    Data/       ScriptableObjects, JSON/CSV texts (lore, AI messages, briefing)
    Prefabs/    Rooms/, Props/, Terminals/
    Scenes/     Main.unity, Sandbox_A.unity, Sandbox_B.unity
    Tests/
      EditMode/ tests for ColdShutdown.Core — asmdef ColdShutdown.Tests.EditMode
  ThirdParty/   downloaded assets, one folder per source (see CREDITS.md)
```

All code and tests must live under `Assets/` — Unity does not compile anything outside it.

## Architecture rules

- **Generator and deduction live in `Core` and never touch `UnityEngine`.** They take a seed and
  return plain data (grid, room types, rogue rack, terminals). `LevelBuilder` in Runtime turns that
  data into a scene.
- **Randomness:** use `System.Random(seed)` passed in explicitly. Never `UnityEngine.Random` in Core,
  otherwise the same seed will not produce the same map.
- **Every generated map must pass the solver** (reachable + clues narrow candidates to exactly one rack).
  Keep the "1000 seeds" EditMode test green.
- Rooms: every room prefab has the same footprint (12 × 12 m) and an opening on all four sides;
  the builder closes unused openings with wall plugs.
- Systems communicate through C# events (e.g. `OnClueFound`, `OnInfectionStep`), not direct references
  between unrelated components.
- Texts (lore, AI messages, briefing) are data in `Assets/_Project/Data`, never hard-coded strings.
- Lighting is realtime (Forward+). No baked lightmaps — the map is generated at runtime.

## Working rules for Claude

- Do **not** hand-edit `.unity`, `.prefab` or `.asset` YAML unless explicitly asked. Prefer an editor
  script (menu item under `Tools/Cold Shutdown/`) that creates or changes the asset, and tell the user
  to run it.
- Never modify `Library/`, `Temp/`, `Logs/`, `UserSettings/` or generated `.csproj`/`.sln` files.
- When you create new files under `Assets/`, remind the user to focus the Unity Editor so it generates
  the `.meta` files, and that `.meta` files must be committed together with the asset.
- New third-party asset → put it in `Assets/ThirdParty/<Source>/` and add a row to `CREDITS.md`.
- Keep changes small and focused; one feature per branch.

## Commands

Run EditMode tests from the command line (the Editor must be closed for this project):

```
"<path-to-Unity.exe>" -batchmode -projectPath . -runTests -testPlatform EditMode -testResults ./TestResults.xml -logFile -
```

On Windows the path is usually `C:\Program Files\Unity\Hub\Editor\<version>\Editor\Unity.exe`.
